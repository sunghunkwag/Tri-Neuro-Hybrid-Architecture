# Tri-Neuro Hybrid Architecture

An experimental prototype exploring the integration of heterogeneous neural modules — Transformer, JEPA, and Liquid Neural Networks — through a shared latent manifold with adaptive routing. This is early-stage research code; the architecture is untested on real-world tasks and serves as a testbed for investigating cross-modal representation bridging between fundamentally different neural paradigms.
